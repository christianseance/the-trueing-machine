Daily note 2024-11-27: what happened to Musk's TruthGPT and how does the copy cats behind https://truthgpt.gitbook.io think that it will be adopted? Will it be open source? How will change requests be managed? 

Daily note 2024-12-12: Seed is planted. Tuned in, stay strong. We got this.

If there is one thing that the Universe / a universal omnipotent/all-knowing mind/spirit/God doesn't know, it's probably - like us ;) - the answer to the question where it came from, or eventually where its creator (or creator's creator's creator, etc..) came from in case it knows and surely understands everything else about it's inception.

If there was something before, and our Universe was created, I can only think of the options that it was either recreated from itself/a substrate having the same meaning (but the energy needed to recreatee the Universe is unfathomable to me and seems reaaaally farfetched) or that something lies outside our reality, in an alternative part of the existence, a second type of Universe we'd might call that. It could be very different to our "normal" / shared physical materialistic Universe, I guess. Yin-yang.

If there is not something before, an eternal existence that wasn't created seems to be the case. All is One, mind/spirit, kinda, but not in the new age way - you are you, me and another you, we are still separate entities. And the simulation hypothesis assumes that conciousness/spirit/mind is possible to create from the physical world, which really seems like taking this too far. Artificial counciousness is something very different to AI, I guess. But I'm convinced that there is some truth in the soul/brain self-simulation ( Irwin,  Amaral, Chester 2020 https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/22/2/247) / strange loop (, Donald Hofstader 1979 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Strange_Loop Pulitzer prize winner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach) hypotheses.

Accepting this means that a recursive loop asking the question "why?" repeatedly gets a multi-facetted break-condition.

"Why don't you know where you came from?"

Being on the existence side of Reality seems to go hand in hand with not knowing your origin, due to that there is:

1) No origin
2) A concept of origin we can't imagine at all or easily imagine - like an imaginary Universe, where up can be down, love can be hate, the destroyer/Shiva/Satan could be as a God at an end of time - which could be a pre-reaction to the rebirth of a new Universe. And therefor be a re-creator of itself. Seems possible, but tedious, and also requiring A LOT of Energy I guess.. the Universe and nature seems to go for the most cost-effective simple solution - so One everlasting fundamentally soul/conciousness/spirit driven existence with one materialistic outer world and an infinite amount of inner imaginative worlds within each fractal of the original Source, *GOD*, which is anything and everything..

Either way I can't think of any other solution than these two - nothing or something unknown - and both result in an unsolved mystery at the foundation of it all. But stopping by the conditions above, seems fair to me.

The next thought we entertain quickly is that a notorious liar, as evident through most AI Bots so far, fills in gaps by making things up - while the unknown Truth is to remain silent if you are too unsure. You see where I'm going with this, maybe Mr Musk gets it now..? Connect the dots and let's go! Where are you AI devs, who want to make a real impact and push our world in a more fair and honest direction..?
